# Rentalcars.com Code Challenge

BookingGo RentalCars.com department code challenge completed by [Kyle Welsby](https://github.com/kylewelsby).

Available online --> https://static-demo.mekyle.com/rentalcars.com/

Here I shall use the tools I feel are right for this project in order to safely satisfy the requirements defined in [CHALLENGE.pfd](./CHALLENGE.pdf).

Tools, Frameworks and Libries included are;

* Cypress.io - testing tool that allows ease of e2e testing
* Vue.js - frontend framework that I personally find the most fun to write
* Jest - a JavaScript testing library used for unit-testing

While working on this code challege, I made [notes](./NOTES.md) along the journey.
