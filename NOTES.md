# Notes

Here I shall share my notes and typed thinking while working through this project.

Looking at the [Challenge Spec](./CHALLENGE.pdf) I see the use of [Gherkin Scenarios](https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/)

I wish to ensure I satisfy these scenarios exactly, so Beahaviour Driven Development [BDD] would be a great starting point.
I shall use E2E testing framework [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) with [Cucumber Plugin](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor)
